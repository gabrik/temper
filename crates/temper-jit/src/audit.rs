//! Re-check a spec's invariants against the entities that actually exist.
//!
//! The verification cascade proves properties of a *model*: an abstraction in
//! which state variables are counters, bools and lists, every write comes from
//! a declared effect, and the reachable state space is whatever those effects
//! generate. That proof is only about the real system to the extent the model
//! matches it, and there are three places it does not:
//!
//!   * **Fields, which the cascade refuses to model at all.** An `[[invariant]]`
//!     may not read a field -- the parser rejects it and directs the author to
//!     `[[field_invariant]]`, which is checked *on writes*. That is a real
//!     check, and it is also the narrowest possible one: it sees a row only
//!     when something writes to it. A field invariant added today has never
//!     been evaluated against a single row written yesterday, and never will
//!     be until something happens to touch one.
//!   * **State that predates the current spec.** Entities persist across spec
//!     edits. Tightening an invariant proves the *new* spec consistent; it says
//!     nothing about rows written under the old one, which keep whatever they
//!     had.
//!   * **Liveness the runtime does not enforce.** `[[state_timeout]]` is a
//!     declaration, not a watchdog. An entity whose callback never arrives sits
//!     in a transient state indefinitely and no level of the cascade is looking.
//!
//! So this module asks a different question than the cascade does. Not "can the
//! model reach a bad state" but "is any entity in one now". It is deliberately
//! cheap and total: every invariant against every entity, using the same
//! evaluator the runtime uses to admit writes, so a violation here is a
//! violation by the runtime's own definition rather than a modelling artifact.
//!
//! Findings are observations, not proofs of a bug. A violated invariant means
//! the spec and the data disagree, and which one is wrong is a judgement.
