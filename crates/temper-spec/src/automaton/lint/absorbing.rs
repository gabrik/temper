/// Flag a literal write that can silently absorb a concurrent write, in a
/// state whose invariant polices the variable written.
///
/// This is a structural check for a race the cascade cannot see. Each level
/// reasons about one entity's transitions in isolation; what goes wrong here is
/// two actions legal in the same state disagreeing about who owns a variable,
/// and the losing write vanishing without an error.
///
/// The pattern, and why each clause is load-bearing:
///
///   1. Action `A` transitions to `T` and assigns a **literal** to `v`. A
///      literal is a claim made from nothing -- unlike a `params.`-derived
///      value, it cannot have come from an observation, so it asserts a fact
///      rather than reporting one.
///   2. Some invariant makes `T` *mean* something about `v`. Without this the
///      overwrite is just a write; with it, `A` satisfies the invariant by
///      construction and the invariant stops being evidence of anything.
///   3. Another **input** action `B` is legal in a state `A` fires from and
///      also writes `v`. Input actions are client- and module-triggerable, so
///      `B` genuinely races `A`; an internal action is sequenced by the server.
///
/// Together these say: `B` observes the world and records it in `v`, `A`
/// overwrites `v` with an assertion, and the entity arrives in `T` advertising
/// a property that `B` had just contradicted. The cascade reports nothing,
/// because every individual transition is legal and the invariant holds in
/// every state it can reach -- it holds precisely *because* `A` wrote it.
///
/// A warning rather than an error: the pattern is sometimes deliberate, and
/// which of the three remedies applies is a design decision the message lays
/// out rather than makes.
